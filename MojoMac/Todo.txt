General:

- Add time remaining and file downloading rate to HTTPClient

Specific:

- Fix stupid autosizing when hiding/unhiding table columns
- Full TLS support
- When setting name of xmpp user, also set for bonjour (just in case)

Clever Ideas:

- Gnome style type-to-find matching in table view
  When a row is selected in a table view, and the user starts typing, table view should draw
  a transparent overlay of the characters the user has typed.
